# The MC field is a skeleton for constructing new modules
MC:
# The include section is optional. You can use this section to copy files 
# from the directory where you are running the app to the user directory to be
# used in the app and when saved. The source and dest options can be a path
# command like below or a double
# quoted string: '"/path/to/file"'
# The dest should be relative to user directory (think the root of the zip
# file that is exported). See formods.yaml for examples. 
#
# include:
#   files:
#   - file:
#       source: 'file.path(system.file(package="onbrand"), "templates", "report.docx")'
#       dest:   'file.path("config","report.docx")'
  code: # module specific code options
    packages: ["XXX"]
    readOnly: TRUE

  # Controls what is shown in the compact ui mode:
  compact:
    code:    TRUE 
    clip:    TRUE 
  # This is where you put reporting options. The expected options are shown
  # here, but module-specific options can also be added if needed:
  reporting:
    enabled: FALSE
    # Priority of reporting relative to other modules 
    # (higher numbers are reported first)
    priority: 1
  # put different formatting options (widths, heights,
  # shinyWidgets button sizes, etc) here.
  formatting:
    # Dimensions of code snippet box
